# Computational Statistics Summary

This summary was written based on the lecture Computational Statistics at ETH ZÃ¼rich for the exam. It is a fork of a summary from [FS19](https://github.com/anklinv/Computational-Statistics-ETH-FS19) by [@anklinv](https://github.com/anklinv/).

The changes for 2020 include few clarifications and additions of formulas and hints I consider relevant.
It is slightly more convoluted (smaller font size and margins) while also having few improvements of legibility (no background color in code boxes, as example).

### Feel free to fork, adapt and improve for the coming years!

The template is based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36768704/10613790) for the structure and [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/colourful-cheatsheet-template/qdsshbjktndd) for the code boxes.
